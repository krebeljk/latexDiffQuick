# latexDiffQuick

[latexdiff](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff) your LaTeX folder/repository with minimal effort.

You probably:
* Just want to diff your LaTeX ASAP.
* Don't want to learn commands you'll forget.
* Want minimal new mess on your computer.

## How-to

* Default-install [perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html).
* Put this repository next to your LaTeX repository (so they have the same parent folder).
* Follow the txt/bat files. Adjust as needed.

## Remarks
Diffing is very easy if you're using git (version control software). Otherwise have a look at the steps and manage without.

It's for Windows so you might have to translate the batch files to shell scripts.

The latexdiff.pl is the untouched latexdiff script.
It's there so you know where it is. 
You can replace it with the [latest release](https://github.com/ftilmann/latexdiff/blob/master/latexdiff).
